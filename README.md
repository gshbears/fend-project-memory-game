## description
This game is the classic memory card game. The object is to find the matching pairs of cards with symbols on them. The moves counter will remove the a star as they increment moves past 12 and again at 20 moves. Try to win the game with 3 stars and improve your time with each game. To reset the game you can either refresh your browser or click the restart button.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
